<h1 id="comparison">Comparison with other TeX formats</h1>

<p>Bhrìd TeX is a format targeted at those who are not at ease with
LaTeX and wish something more in the spirit of Plain TeX. In
comparison with plain TeX, Bhrìd TeX offers the following:</p>
<ul>
	  <li>a complex macro library system, that can do tests
	  against library version;</li>

	  <li>a support for document class and document style
	  libraries;</li>

	  <li>a support for localization, the document class writer
	  can easily load token registers and macro registers
	  according to a locale variant pair;</li>

	  <li>a support for a selection scheme, it allows font
	  matching against independent criteria;</li>

	  <li>a support for different object documents formats (DVI,
	  PostScript, and PDF).</li>

</ul>

<p>However, Bhrìd TeX is not Plain TeX, neither an improved version of
Plain TeX. It was completely written from scratch.</p>


<h1 id="subversive">A format for niche printing</h1>

<p>Bhrìd TeX is far less advanced than LaTeX, does not try to match
it neither to replace it. It is however very usable, I rely on it
systematically for my own private productions.</p>

<p>As Bhrìd TeX is still experimental, I recommand you do not use
Bhrìd TeX for your own productions, since its interface is still very
malleable and you will probably not receive support for it. You are of
course very welcome to play with Bhrìd TeX, to use it to discover TeX,
and to take part in its development.</p>
